# CLI

`osh` is a command-line interface for Odoo.sh, in the spirit of `gcloud`, `aws` and `scw`. It is
built on the [`odouche` library](library.md) and adds nothing of its own beyond presentation:
every command is a call into the library, rendered for a terminal.

This page is the guide. The [reference](cli-reference.md) has every command with its arguments,
options and defaults, as `osh <command> --help` prints them.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install odouche-cli
osh --version
```

To run it once without installing it:

```bash
uvx --from odouche-cli osh --help
```

## Sign in

```bash
osh auth login
```

- A browser window opens for you to sign in to Odoo.sh with GitHub. `osh` stores the session in
  your operating system's keyring and names the account. Where no browser can be launched, as over
  SSH, it asks for the `session_id` cookie in a prompt that does not echo it.
- [Security](security.md) has what is kept, where and for how long.
- [`osh auth status`](cli-reference.md#osh-auth-status) shows where the session comes from, how
  long ago it was stored and when it expires. It exits 3 when there is no usable session, so a
  script can test for one.
- [`osh auth logout`](cli-reference.md#osh-auth-logout) removes the session from the keyring and
  says whether Odoo.sh ended it.
- No option takes a session: arguments show in the process list and in the shell history. Where
  there is no keyring, as in CI, the session comes from
  [`ODOUCHE_SESSION`](#environment-variables).

## Push, watch, read the logs

From a checkout of the repository that the project `acme` builds, on the branch `feature-x`:

```bash
git push
osh builds watch
osh logs
```

- [`osh builds watch`](cli-reference.md#osh-builds-watch) waits for the build of the commit you
  pushed, follows it until it finishes and exits with [its result](#exit-codes). Its last line is
  the result and the address of the build's database:

    ```text
    Build 1234 failed: https://acme-feature-x-1234.dev.odoo.com
    ```

- [`osh logs`](cli-reference.md#osh-logs) prints the end of that build's `install` log, where a
  development build installs the modules and runs their tests. A build that has none, as on a
  staging branch, gives its `odoo` log. `osh logs --follow` keeps printing while the build runs.
- As one line: `git push && (osh builds watch || osh logs)`.
- Anywhere else, name the two: `osh builds watch --project acme --branch feature-x`.
- [`osh builds rebuild --watch`](#rebuilding-a-branch) starts a new build of the branch without a
  commit, and watches it.

## Project and branch

A command that works on a project or a branch takes them from the first of these that gives a
value:

| Order | Project | Branch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `--project` | `--branch` |
| 2 | `OSH_PROJECT` | `OSH_BRANCH` |
| 3 | The git checkout's remote, when it is a GitHub repository | The git checkout's current branch |

- The project is given by its name, as `osh projects list` shows it.
- The remote is the upstream of the current branch, and `origin` otherwise. A detached HEAD
  gives no branch.
- A repository that several of your projects build is never guessed between: the command exits 2
  and lists them. One that none of them builds exits 4.
- With no source giving a value, or an empty `--project` or `--branch`, the command exits 2.
- `--debug` says on stderr which source was used.

## Watching a build

`osh builds watch` follows one build until it finishes: the one whose number is given, or the
build of the commit you just pushed.

- When the checkout is of the project's repository and on the branch, however the two were named,
  it waits for a build of the checkout's HEAD to be listed, asking every 3 seconds, and watches
  that one.
- `--commit` waits for another commit of the branch, also when the branch is not the one checked
  out.
- `--no-wait` watches the branch's latest build, whatever its commit, and so does a run with
  no `--commit` on another project or branch than the checkout's, or one where HEAD cannot be
  read.
- The wait for a commit's build lasts two minutes at most, then exits 23: push the commit, or use
  `--no-wait`. `--timeout` covers that wait and the build.
- The changes go to stderr: one line kept up to date when stderr is a terminal, with how long the
  build has run, and one line per change otherwise. The last line, on stdout, is the result and
  the address of the build's database.
- A build that was dropped after it finished exits with the result it had, and is said to have
  been replaced by a newer build. A dropped build has no address.
- Ctrl+C exits 130 and leaves the build running: watching changes nothing on Odoo.sh.

## Rebuilding a branch

`osh builds rebuild` is the one command that changes a project: it starts a new build of the
branch, which replaces its latest one. Every other command that opens a client opens it
read-only, and it sends no change.

- Only a development or a staging branch is rebuilt. Any other stage exits 9 before anything is
  asked or sent.
- It first says on stderr what it works on: the project, the branch with its stage, and the
  branch's latest build with its commit. Then it asks on stderr, and anything but `y` or `yes`
  sends nothing and exits 1.
- `--yes` rebuilds without asking. When stdin or stderr is not a terminal it is required: without
  it the command exits 2 and sends nothing. In a script: `osh builds rebuild --yes --watch`.
- Once the rebuild is sent, stderr names the new build. It is then shown as `osh builds show`
  shows one.
- `--watch` watches the new build as `osh builds watch` does, with that command's output and exit
  codes.
- A watch that fails leaves the build as it is: stderr names it, for `osh builds watch` to follow.
  Another `rebuild` would start a second build.
- The rebuild is sent once. When Odoo.sh does not confirm it, or the new build is not found, the
  command exits 10: look at `osh builds list` before running it again, since a second rebuild
  can start a second build.

## Reading a log

A log is untrusted text, and `osh logs` writes it to stdout only: nothing of a log goes to
stderr, with `--debug` or without.

- On a terminal the escape sequences and control characters are removed from each line, tabs
  kept, so a line cannot clear the screen or set the window's title. When stdout is a pipe or a
  file the lines are written as they are. `--strip` and `--no-strip` force one or the other.
- A line longer than 64 KiB is cut, and bytes that are not UTF-8 are replaced. A character
  stdout cannot encode is written as its escape, such as `\u2192`.
- Each line is flushed as it is printed. When the pipe it is written to closes, as under
  `osh logs | head`, the command ends with nothing on stderr and exits 141.
- `--follow` asks Odoo.sh for new lines every second, until Ctrl+C, which exits 130.
- `--kinds` lists the logs the build has: the kind, what Odoo.sh calls the log, its size and how
  long ago it was last written to. A kind `osh` does not know is `unknown`, and `--kind` takes
  its name. A build that waits for a worker has no log yet.
- A log the build does not have exits 4, and the message names the ones it has.

## A shell on a build

`osh ssh` opens a shell on the latest build of the [branch](#project-and-branch), with your own
`ssh`: its configuration, its agent and the keys registered on your Odoo.sh account. `osh` reads
no key, and its process becomes `ssh`, so the exit code is then `ssh`'s.

- The options of `osh` come first. Everything from the first argument on is given to `ssh` after
  the host: a command to run on the build, or options of `ssh`. Put `--` before it when it starts
  with a dash: `osh ssh -- -L 8069:localhost:8069`.
- A build with no address exits 4.
- Where there is no `ssh` to become, as on native Windows, the command to run by hand is shown
  and `osh` exits 14.

## Scripts

### Output

`--format table` (the default) or `--format json`, given before the command. Only the result is
written to stdout, so `osh --format json ... | jq` receives nothing else.

```bash
osh --format json builds show --project acme --branch feature-x | jq -r .result
```

- JSON is the whole model of the library, and its keys are the model's attribute names in the
  [API reference](reference.md). Datetimes are ISO 8601 with an offset.

    | Command | JSON on stdout |
    | --- | --- |
    | `osh auth status` | One `SessionInfo`. |
    | `osh auth status --check` | One `Identity`, with the `SessionInfo` as its `session`. |
    | `osh projects list` | An array of `Project`. |
    | `osh branches list` | An array of `Branch`, in the order of the table. |
    | `osh builds list` | An array of `Build`. |
    | `osh builds show`, `osh builds rebuild` | One `Build`. |
    | `osh builds watch`, `osh builds rebuild --watch` | One `Build` per line, for each change, the first being the new build after a rebuild. The result line goes to stderr. |
    | `osh logs` | One `LogLine` per line. |
    | `osh logs --kinds` | An array of `Log`. |

- Three commands print an object of `osh`'s own, on one line:

    | Command | JSON on stdout |
    | --- | --- |
    | `osh auth login` | `identity`: the `Identity` of the stored session, or `null` when `ODOUCHE_SESSION` is set. |
    | `osh auth logout` | `source`: where the session came from, or `null` with none. `deleted`: whether it was removed from the keyring. `invalidated`: whether Odoo.sh ended it. `failure`: why Odoo.sh could not be asked, or `null`. |
    | `osh --version` | `osh` and `odouche`: the version of each. |

- An empty result is `[]` as JSON, and one line on stderr as a table. Both exit 0.
- A table has no colour and no box drawing when stdout is not a terminal or `NO_COLOR` is set.
  The result of a build is coloured on a terminal, and always written out.
- A table shows times as how long ago they were. JSON has the time itself.
- A stage, a status or a result `osh` does not know is shown as Odoo.sh names it.
- A table has the control characters removed from every cell, and a tab or a line break made a
  space, so a commit message cannot drive the terminal. JSON has them escaped, in a `LogLine`
  too, so `--strip` has no effect on it. The lines of [`osh logs`](#reading-a-log) keep them when
  stdout is not a terminal.

### Exit codes

A command that fails prints one or two lines on stderr, what happened and what to do, and nothing
on stdout. Three commands do otherwise:

- `osh builds watch`, and `osh builds rebuild --watch` like it, exits non-zero for a build that
  did not succeed, with the result line on stdout, or on stderr as JSON. `osh builds list` and
  `osh builds show` exit 0 whatever the build's result.
- `osh logs` can fail after lines went to stdout, at a follow's timeout (8) or when a request
  fails (7).
- `osh ssh`, once it has become `ssh`, exits with what `ssh` exits with: the code of the remote
  command, or 255 for an error of `ssh` itself. The table below is not how to read it.

| Code | Meaning | Returned by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Success. `osh auth logout` with nothing to log out of is one. | Every command |
| 1 | Unexpected error, which is a bug to report, or a prompt or a question that was declined. | Every command |
| 2 | Usage error: an unknown option, a value an option does not take, options that do not go together, no [project or branch](#project-and-branch), or a rebuild that cannot ask. | Every command |
| 3 | No session, or an expired one. Run `osh auth login`. | Every command that needs the session |
| 4 | The project, branch, build or log is not one the logged-in user can reach. A build that is not among the branch's latest ones is not, and neither is the build of a branch that has none. | Every command that takes a project |
| 5 | The session is not allowed to do this. | Every command that asks Odoo.sh |
| 6 | Odoo.sh answered in a shape `osh` does not read. Please report it. | Every command that asks Odoo.sh |
| 7 | Odoo.sh could not be reached, or answered with a server error. | Every command that asks Odoo.sh |
| 8 | A followed log or a login reached its timeout. | `osh logs --follow --timeout`, `osh auth login` |
| 9 | Refused, and nothing was changed: a read-only run, or a branch in a stage `osh` does not change. | `osh builds rebuild` |
| 10 | A change was sent and Odoo.sh did not confirm it. `osh builds list` shows whether the build was started. | `osh builds rebuild` |
| 11 | No usable keyring: none to store the session in, or one that stayed locked. | `osh auth login`, `osh auth logout`, every command that reads the stored session |
| 12 | The login ended without a session. | `osh auth login` |
| 13 | Any other error from the library. | Every command |
| 14 | No `ssh` to hand over to, or native Windows. The command to run is shown. | `osh ssh` |
| 20 | The build failed. `osh logs` is the next step. | `osh builds watch`, `osh builds rebuild --watch` |
| 21 | The build finished with warnings. | `osh builds watch`, `osh builds rebuild --watch` |
| 22 | The build ended without a result. It was dropped for a newer build, killed or skipped, or its result is one `osh` does not know. | `osh builds watch`, `osh builds rebuild --watch` |
| 23 | The build had not finished, or had not appeared, at the timeout. | `osh builds watch`, `osh builds rebuild --watch` |
| 24 to 29 | Reserved for the result of a build. | None yet |
| 130 | Interrupted with Ctrl+C. | Every command |
| 141 | Stdout is a pipe and its reader, such as `head`, closed it. Nothing is written to stderr. | Every command |

`--debug`, or `OSH_DEBUG=1`, adds the traceback on stderr. It shows no local variables, and a
session supplied through `ODOUCHE_SESSION` is masked in it.

### Environment variables

| Variable | What it does | Read by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ODOUCHE_SESSION` | The session to use, as the value of the `session_id` cookie of `www.odoo.sh`. It is kept in memory only, and the keyring is not read. | Every command that needs the session |
| `OSH_PROJECT` | The [project](#project-and-branch), when `--project` is not given. | Every command that takes `--project` |
| `OSH_BRANCH` | The [branch](#project-and-branch), when `--branch` is not given. | Every command that takes `--branch` |
| `OSH_DEBUG` | `OSH_DEBUG=1` is `--debug`. | Every command |
| `NO_COLOR` | Set to a value that is not empty, it leaves tables without colour and box drawing. | Every command that prints a table |
| `DISPLAY`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` | On Linux, with neither set, no browser is launched and the cookie is asked for. | `osh auth login` |
| `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` | The proxy that requests to Odoo.sh are sent through, and the hosts that are reached without it. The lowercase names are read too. `HTTP_PROXY` has no effect: every request is HTTPS. | Every command that asks Odoo.sh |
| `SSL_CERT_FILE`, `SSL_CERT_DIR` | The certificate authorities trusted for those requests, as a file or a directory, in place of the system's. The file wins over the directory. | Every command that asks Odoo.sh |

- With `ODOUCHE_SESSION` set, `osh auth login` still stores the session it gets in the keyring,
  and `osh auth logout` leaves the variable for you to unset.
- Git, which reads the checkout, and Rich, which draws the tables and the help, read variables of
  their own, such as `GIT_DIR` and `TERM`.

## Shell completion

```bash
osh --install-completion
```

- It installs completion for the shell it is run from, such as bash, zsh or fish: a script under
  the home directory, and for bash and zsh a line in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`. It takes effect in
  a new shell.
- `osh --show-completion` prints the script instead, to install it yourself.
- Commands, options and the values an option lists are completed. Names of projects and branches
  are not: completing asks Odoo.sh nothing and does not open the keyring.
- It needs `osh` on the `PATH`, so it does not go with `uvx`.
